                I am a determined, fast-learning person whom proves
                crucial to team success when given the opportunity. I have worked with numerous 
                languages to accomplish anything from producing results in a work environment to developing
                personal projects regarding my interests as well as to facilitate my own day to day tasks. 
                I am constantly searching for a way to feed my curiosity and accomplish that through constant 
                learning. I am passionate about data and development because as technology progresses, there is 
                no cap to what we as people may accomplish. I am focused on pursuing opportunities in Data Science
                and software engineering, though I am open to other opportunities in similar environments.  </h1>
